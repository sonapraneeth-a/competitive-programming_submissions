# Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of
the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you
may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

```markdown
**Input:** nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
**Output:** [0,1]
**Explanation:** Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

**Example 2:**

```markdown
**Input:** nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
**Output:** [1,2]
```

**Example 3:**

```markdown
**Input:** nums = [3,3], target = 6
**Output:** [0,1]
```

**Constraints:**

-   `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
-   `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
-   `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
-   **Only one valid answer exists.**

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n^2)`
time complexity?
