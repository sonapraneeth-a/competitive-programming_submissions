# Description

Given the **API** `rand7()` that generates a uniform random integer in the range `[1, 7]`, write a function `rand10()` that generates a uniform random integer in the range `[1, 10]`. You can only call the API `rand7()`, and you shouldn't call any other API. Please **do not** use a language's built-in random API.


Each test case will have one **internal** argument `n`, the number of times that your implemented function `rand10()` will be called while testing. Note that this is **not an argument** passed to `rand10()`.


**Follow up:**


* What is the [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) for the number of calls to `rand7()` function?
* Could you minimize the number of calls to `rand7()`?


 


**Example 1:**



```
**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** [2]

```
**Example 2:**



```
**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** [2,8]

```
**Example 3:**



```
**Input:** n = 3
**Output:** [3,8,10]

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= n <= 105`
