# Description

You are given an `m x n` matrix of characters `box` representing a side-view of a box. Each cell of the box is one of the following:


* A stone `'#'`
* A stationary obstacle `'*'`
* Empty `'.'`


The box is rotated **90 degrees clockwise**, causing some of the stones to fall due to gravity. Each stone falls down until it lands on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box. Gravity **does not** affect the obstacles' positions, and the inertia from the box's rotation **does not** affect the stones' horizontal positions.


It is **guaranteed** that each stone in `box` rests on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box.


Return *an* `n x m` *matrix representing the box after the rotation described above*.

```

**Input:** box = [["#",".","#"]]
**Output:** [["."],
         ["#"],
         ["#"]]

```

**Example 2:**


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/rotatingtheboxleetcode2withstones.png)



```

**Input:** box = [["#",".","*","."],
              ["#","#","*","."]]
**Output:** [["#","."],
         ["#","#"],
         ["*","*"],
         [".","."]]

```

**Example 3:**


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/rotatingtheboxleetcode3withstone.png)



```

**Input:** box = [["#","#","*",".","*","."],
              ["#","#","#","*",".","."],
              ["#","#","#",".","#","."]]
**Output:** [[".","#","#"],
         [".","#","#"],
         ["#","#","*"],
         ["#","*","."],
         ["#",".","*"],
         ["#",".","."]]

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `m == box.length`
* `n == box[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 500`
* `box[i][j]` is either `'#'`, `'*'`, or `'.'`.
