# Description

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return *the number of islands*.


An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
**Output:** 1

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
**Output:** 3

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 300`
* `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.
