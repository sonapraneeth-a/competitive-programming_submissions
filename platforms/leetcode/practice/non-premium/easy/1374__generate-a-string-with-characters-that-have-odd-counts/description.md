# Description

Given an integer `n`, *return a string with `n` characters such that each character in such string occurs **an odd number of times***.


The returned string must contain only lowercase English letters. If there are multiples valid strings, return **any** of them.  


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** n = 4
**Output:** "pppz"
**Explanation:** "pppz" is a valid string since the character 'p' occurs three times and the character 'z' occurs once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ohhh" and "love".

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** "xy"
**Explanation:** "xy" is a valid string since the characters 'x' and 'y' occur once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ag" and "ur".

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** n = 7
**Output:** "holasss"

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= n <= 500`
