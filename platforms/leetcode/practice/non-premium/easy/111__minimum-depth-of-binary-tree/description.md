# Description

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.


The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.


**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.


 


**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
**Output:** 2

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
**Output:** 5

```

 


**Constraints:**


* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 105]`.
* `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
